# Learning Algorithms- Spring 2022

**Instructors**: Professor [Maziar Salahi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8cXhHrsAAAAJ&hl=en) and Assis.Professor [Sadegh Eskandari](https://sadegh28.github.io/eskandari) 

**Lectures**: Sunday 13:15-14:45 and Thursday 13:15-14:45

**Online communication**: (Videos and Homeworks) [https://ecent2.guilan.ac.ir/](https://ecent2.guilan.ac.ir/)

**Textbooks**: [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/prml-book/) by C. Bishop, and [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) by A. GÃ©ron

**Description**: This course aims to teach the fundamentals of machine learning. We will take an in-depth look at probability theory, Bayesian probability, parametric and non-parametric density estimation, linear regression and classification, neural networds, sparse kernel methods and decision trees. We will also provide hands-on lectures using Scikit-Learn.
